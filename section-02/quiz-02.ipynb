    "You just got hired as a manufacturer designer for Apple and are working on the bands for their watches. A band for a watch comes in two pieces, the top piece and the bottom piece, each piece is attached separately to the watch and then joined together when a user puts the watch on their wrist.  The top and bottom pieces are created in batches at a factory owned by FoxConn. A very important factor in creating the bands is to make sure that their lengths of both sides are uniform, otherwise the latching won't work when trying to put it on a wrist. Apple has instituted a quality control check based on the standard deviation of each batch of bands produced.\n",
